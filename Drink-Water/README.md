Ever feel like your lips and/or skin are dry? Brain not firing as fast during a long coding session? First, stand up and take a break. You deserve it! Second, have you had enough water today?  

This is a simple applet to track the water you have consumed during the day. Clicking a glass adds it to the total amount in a fun, visual way.
